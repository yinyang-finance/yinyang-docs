# Governance

Funds collected from the [Contract Secured Revenues](https://docs.canto.io/evm-development/contract-secured-revenue) and from [farms](./1.%20farms.md)'s deposit fees are controlled by a [Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#governor).

The token used to control the Governor is $ZEN. It can also be delegated but the interface for it is not yet ready...
